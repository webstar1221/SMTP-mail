oj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- rsyslogd now checks on startup if it is capable to performa any work
  at all. If it cant, it complains and terminates
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- fixed a small memory leak when HUPing syslogd. The allowed sender
  list now gets freed. thanks to mildew for the patch.
- changed the way error messages in early startup are logged. They
  now do no longer use the syslogd code directly but are rather
  send to stderr.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.2 (rgerhards), 2007-07-23
- made the port part of the -r option optional. Needed for backward
  compatibility with sysklogd
- replaced system() calls with something more reasonable. Please note that
  this might break compatibility with some existing configuration files.
  We accept this in favour of the gained security.
- removed a memory leak that could occur if timegenerated was used in
  RFC 3164 format in templates
- did some preparation in msg.c for advanced multithreading - placed the
  hooks, but not yet any active code
- worked further on modularization
- added $ModLoad MySQL (dummy) config directive
- added DropTrailingLFOnReception config directive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.1 (rgerhards), 2007-07-20
- fixed a bug that caused make install to install rsyslogd and rklogd under
  the wrong names
- fixed bug that caused $AllowedSenders to handle IPv6 scopes incorrectly;
  also fixed but that could grabble $AllowedSender wildcards. Thanks to
  mildew@gmail.com for the patch
- minor code cleanup - thanks to Peter Vrabec for the patch
- fixed minimal memory leak on HUP (caused by templates)
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- fixed another memory leak on HUPing and on exiting rsyslogd
  again thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- code cleanup (removed compiler warnings)
- fixed portability bug in configure.ac - thanks to Bartosz Kuźma for patch
- moved msg object into its own file set
- added the capability to continue trying to write log files when the
  file system is full. Functionality based on patch by Martin Schulze
  to sysklogd package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17.0 (RGer), 2007-07-17
- added $RepeatedLineReduction config parameter
- added $EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive config parameter
- added $ControlCharacterEscapePrefix config parameter
- added $DirCreateMode config parameter
- added $CreateDirs config parameter
- added $DebugPrintTemplateList config parameter
- added $ResetConfigVariables config parameter
- added $FileOwner config parameter
- added $FileGroup config parameter
- added $DirOwner config parameter
- added $DirGroup config parameter
- added $FailOnChownFailure config parameter
- added regular expression support to the filter engine
  thanks to Michel Samia for providing the patch!
- enhanced $AllowedSender functionality. Credits to mildew@gmail.com for
  the patch doing that
  - added IPv6 support
  - allowed DNS hostnames
  - allowed DNS wildcard names
- added new option $DropMsgsWithMaliciousDnsPTRRecords
- added autoconf so that rfc3195d, rsyslogd and klogd are stored to /sbin
- added capability to auto-create directories with dynaFiles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.16.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-07-13 - The Friday, 13th Release ;)
- build system switched to autotools
- removed SYSV preprocessor macro use, replaced with autotools equivalents
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to segfault when TCP listening was
  disabled and it terminated
- added new properties "syslogfacility-text" and "syslogseverity-text"
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- added the -x option to disable hostname dns reslution
  thanks to varmojfekoj <varmojfekoj@gmail.com> for the patch
- begun to better modularize syslogd.c - this is an ongoing project; moved
  type definitions to a separate file
- removed some now-unused fields from struct filed
- move file size limit fields in struct field to the "right spot" (the file
  writing part of the union - f_un.f_file)
- subdirectories linux and solaris are no longer part of the distribution
  package. This is not because we cease support for them, but there are no
  longer any files in them after the move to autotools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.1 (RGer), 2007-07-10
- fixed a bug that caused a dynaFile selector to stall when there was
  an open error with one file 
- improved template processing for dynaFiles; templates are now only
  looked up during initialization - speeds up processing
- optimized memory layout in struct filed when compiled with MySQL
  support
- fixed a bug that caused compilation without SYSLOG_INET to fail
- re-enabled the "last message repeated n times" feature. This
  feature was not taken care of while rsyslogd evolved from sysklogd
  and it was more or less defunct. Now it is fully functional again.
- added system properties: $NOW, $YEAR, $MONTH, $DAY, $HOUR, $MINUTE
- fixed a bug in iovAsString() that caused a memory leak under stress
  conditions (most probably memory shortage). This was unlikely to
  ever happen, but it doesn't hurt doing it right
- cosmetic: defined type "uchar", change all unsigned chars to uchar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.0 (RGer), 2007-07-05
- added ability to dynamically generate file names based on templates
  and thus properties. This was a much-requested feature. It makes
  life easy when it e.g. comes to splitting files based on the sender
  address.
- added $umask and $FileCreateMode config file directives
- applied a patch from Bartosz Kuzma to compile cleanly under NetBSD
- checks for extra (unexpected) characters in system config file lines
  have been added
- added IPv6 documentation - was accidently missing from CVS
- begun to change char to unsigned char
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.2 (RGer), 2007-07-03
** this release fixes all known nits with IPv6 **
- restored capability to do /etc/service lookup for "syslog"
  service when -r 0 was given
- documented IPv6 handling of syslog messages
- integrate patch from Bartosz Kuźma to make rsyslog compile under
  Solaris again (the patch replaced a strndup() call, which is not
  available under Solaris
- improved debug logging when waiting on select
- updated rsyslogd man page with new options (-46A)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.1 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-29
- added Peter Vrabec's patch for IPv6 TCP
- prefixed all messages send to stderr in rsyslogd with "rsyslogd: "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14.0 (RGer/Peter Vrabec), 2007-06-28
- Peter Vrabec provided IPv6 for rsyslog, so we are now IPv6 enabled
  IPv6 Support is currently for UDP only, TCP is to come soon.
  AllowedSender configuration does not yet work for IPv6.
- fixed code in iovCreate() that broke C's strict aliasing rules 
- fixed some char/unsigned char differences that forced the compiler
  to spit out warning messages
- updated the Red Hat init script to fix a known issue (thanks to
  Peter Vrabec)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.5 (RGer), 2007-06-22
- made the TCP session limit configurable via command line switch
  now -t <port>,<max sessions>
- added man page for rklogd(8) (basically a copy from klogd, but now
  there is one...)
- fixed a bug that caused internal messages (e.g. rsyslogd startup) to
  appear without a tag.
- removed a minor memory leak that occurred when TAG processing requalified
  a HOSTNAME to be a TAG (and a TAG already was set).
- removed potential small memory leaks in MsgSet***() functions. There
  would be a leak if a property was re-set, something that happened
  extremely seldom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.4 (RGer), 2007-06-18
- added a new property "PRI-text", which holds the PRI field in
  textual form (e.g. "syslog.info")
- added alias "syslogseverity" for "syslogpriority", which is a
  misleading property name that needs to stay for historical
  reasons (and backward-compatility)
- added doc on how to record PRI value in log file
- enhanced signal handling in klogd, including removal of an unsafe
  call to the logging system during signal handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.3 (RGer), 2007-06-15
- create a version of syslog.c from scratch. This is now
  - highly optimized for rsyslog
  - removes an incompatible license problem as the original
    version had a BSD license with advertising clause
  - fixed in the regard that rklogd will continue to work when
    rsysogd has been restarted (the original version, as well
    as sysklogd, will remain silent then)
  - solved an issue with an extra NUL char at message end that the
    original version had
- applied some changes to klogd to care for the new interface
- fixed a bug in syslogd.c which prevented compiling under debian
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.2 (RGer), 2007-06-13
- lib order in makefile patched to facilitate static linking - thanks
  to Bennett Todd for providing the patch
- Integrated a patch from Peter Vrabec (pvrabec@redheat.com):
  - added klogd under the name of rklogd (remove dependency on
    original sysklogd package
  - createDB.sql now in UTF
  - added additional config files for use on Red Hat
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.1 (RGer), 2007-02-05
- changed the listen backlog limit to a more reasonable value based on
  the maximum number of TCP connections configurd (10% + 5) - thanks to Guy
  Standen for the hint (actually, the limit was 5 and that was a 
  left-over from early testing).
- fixed a bug in makefile which caused DB-support to be disabled when
  NETZIP support was enabled
- added the -e option to allow transmission of every message to remote
  hosts (effectively turns off duplicate message suppression)
- (somewhat) improved memory consumption when compiled with MySQL support
- looks like we fixed an incompatibility with MySQL 5.x and above software
  At least in one case, the remote server name was destroyed, leading to 
  a connection failure. The new, improved code does not have this issue and
  so we see this as solved (the new code is generally somewhat better, so
  there is a good chance we fixed this incompatibility).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13.0 (RGer), 2006-12-19
- added '$' as ToPos proptery replacer specifier - means "up to the
  end of the string"
- property replacer option "escape-cc", "drop-cc" and "space-cc"  added
- changed the handling of \0 characters inside syslog messages. We now
  consistently escape them to "#000". This is somewhat recommended in
  the draft-ietf-syslog-protocol-19 draft. While the real recomendation
  is to not escape any characters at all, we can not do this without
  considerable modification of the code. So we escape it to "#000", which
  is consistent with a sample found in the Internet-draft.
- removed message glue logic (see printchopped() comment for details)
  Also caused removal of parts table and thus some improvements in
  memory usage.
- changed the default MAXLINE to 2048 to take care of recent syslog
  standardization efforts (can easily be changed in syslogd.c)
- added support for byte-counted TCP syslog messages (much like
  syslog-transport-tls-05 Internet Draft). This was necessary to
  support compression over TCP.
- added support for receiving compressed syslog messages
- added support for sending compressed syslog messages
- fixed a bug where the last message in a syslog/tcp stream was
  lost if it was not properly terminated by a LF character
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.3 (RGer), 2006-10-04
- implemented some changes to support Solaris (but support is not
  yet complete)
- commented out (via #if 0) some methods that are currently not being use
  but should be kept for further us
- added (interim) -u 1 option to turn off hostname and tag parsing
- done some modifications to better support Fedora
- made the field delimiter inside property replace configurable via
  template
- fixed a bug in property replacer: if fields were used, the delimitor
  became part of the field. Up until now, this was barely noticable as 
  the delimiter as TAB only and thus invisible to a human. With other
  delimiters available now, it quickly showed up. This bug fix might cause
  some grief to existing installations if they used the extra TAB for
  whatever reasons - sorry folks... Anyhow, a solution is easy: just add
  a TAB character contstant into your template. Thus, there has no attempt
  been made to do this in a backwards-compatible way.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.2 (RGer), 2006-02-15
- fixed a bug in the RFC 3339 date formatter. An extra space was added
  after the actual timestamp
- added support for providing high-precision RFC3339 timestamps for
  (rsyslogd-)internally-generated messages
- very (!) experimental support for syslog-protocol internet draft
  added (the draft is experimental, the code is solid ;))
- added support for field-extracting in the property replacer
- enhanced the legacy-syslog parser so that it can interpret messages
  that do not contain a TIMESTAMP
- fixed a bug that caused the default socket (usually /dev/log) to be
  opened even when -o command line option was given
- fixed a bug in the Debian sample startup script - it caused rsyslogd
  to listen to remote requests, which it shouldn't by default
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.1 (RGer), 2005-11-23
- made multithreading work with BSD. Some signal-handling needed to be
  restructured. Also, there might be a slight delay of up to 10 seconds
  when huping and terminating rsyslogd under BSD
- fixed a bug where a NULL-pointer was passed to printf() in logmsg().
- fixed a bug during "make install" where rc3195d was not installed
  Thanks to Bennett Todd for spotting this.
- fixed a bug where rsyslogd dumped core when no TAG was found in the
  received message
- enhanced message parser so that it can deal with missing hostnames
  in many cases (may not be totally fail-safe)
- fixed a bug where internally-generated messages did not have the correct
  TAG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12.0 (RGer), 2005-10-26
- moved to a multi-threaded design. single-threading is still optionally
  available. Multi-threading is experimental!
- fixed a potential race condition. In the original code, marking was done
  by an alarm handler, which could lead to all sorts of bad things. This
  has been changed now. See comments in syslogd.c/domark() for details.
- improved debug output for property-based filters
- not a code change, but: I have checked all exit()s to make sure that
  none occurs once rsyslogd has started up. Even in unusual conditions
  (like low-memory conditions) rsyslogd somehow remains active. Of course,
  it might loose a message or two, but at least it does not abort and it
  can also recover when the condition no longer persists.
- fixed a bug that could cause loss of the last message received
  immediately before rsyslogd was terminated.
- added comments on thread-safety of global variables in syslogd.c
- fixed a small bug: spurios printf() when TCP syslog was used
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug with regular expression support (thanks to Andres Riancho)
- a little bit of code restructuring (especially main(), which was
  horribly large)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.1 (RGer), 2005-10-19
- support for BSD-style program name and host blocks
- added a new property "programname" that can be used in templates
- added ability to specify listen port for rfc3195d
- fixed a bug that rendered the "startswith" comparison operation
  unusable.
- changed more functions to "static" storage class to help compiler
  optimize (should have been static in the first place...)
- fixed a potential memory leak in the string buffer class destructor.
  As the destructur was previously never called, the leak did not actually
  appear.
- some internal restructuring in anticipation/preparation of minimal
  multi-threading support
- rsyslogd still shares some code with the sysklogd project. Some patches
  for this shared code have been brought over from the sysklogd CVS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11.0 (RGer), 2005-10-12
- support for receiving messages via RFC 3195; added rfc3195d for that
  purpose
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.2 (RGer), 2005-09-27
- added comparison operations in property-based filters:
  * isequal
  * startswith
- added ability to negate all property-based filter comparison operations
  by adding a !-sign right in front of the operation name
- added the ability to specify remote senders for UDP and TCP
  received messages. Allows to block all but well-known hosts
- changed the $-config line directives to be case-INsensitive
- new command line option -w added: "do not display warnings if messages
  from disallowed senders are received"
- fixed a bug that caused rsyslogd to dump core when the compare value
  was not quoted in property-based filters
- fixed a bug in the new CStr compare function which lead to invalid
  results (fortunately, this function was not yet used widely)
- added better support for "debugging" rsyslog.conf property filters
  (only if -d switch is given)
- changed some function definitions to static, which eventually enables
  some compiler optimizations
- fixed a bug in MySQL code; when a SQL error occured, rsyslogd could
  run in a tight loop. This was due to invalid sequence of error reporting
  and is now fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- added the ability to execute a shell script as an action.
  Thanks to Bjoern Kalkbrenner for providing the code!
- fixed a bug in the MySQL code; due to the bug the automatic one-time
  retry after an error did not happen - this lead to error message in
  cases where none should be seen (e.g. after a MySQL restart)
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  non-(SQL-)standard MySQL features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.0 (RGer), 2005-09-20
  REMINDER: 1.10 is the first unstable version if the 1.x series!
- added the capability to filter on any property in selector lines
  (not just facility and priority)
- changed stringbuf into a new counted string class
- added support for a "discard" action. If a selector line with
  discard (~ character) is found, no selector lines *after* that
  line will be processed.
- thanks to Andres Riancho, regular expression support has been
  added to the template engine
- added the FROMHOST property in the template processor, which could
  previously not be obtained. Thanks to Cristian Testa for pointing
  this out and even providing a fix.
- added display of compile-time options to -v output
- performance improvement for production build - made some checks
  to happen only during debug mode
- fixed a problem with compiling on SUSE and - while doing so - removed
  the socket call to set SO_BSDCOMPAT in cases where it is obsolete.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.4 (RGer), 2006-02-01
- a small but important fix: the tcp receiver had two forgotten printf's
  in it that caused a lot of unnecessary output to stdout. This was
  important enough to justify a new release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.3 (RGer), 2005-11-14
- added an additional guard to prevent rsyslogd from aborting when the
  2gb file size limit is hit. While a user can configure rsyslogd to
  handle such situations, it would abort if that was not done AND large
  file support was not enabled (ok, this is hopefully an unlikely scenario)
- fixed a bug that caused additional Unix domain sockets to be incorrectly
  processed - could lead to message loss in extreme cases
- applied some patches available from the sysklogd project to code
  shared from there
- fixed a bug that causes rsyslogd to dump core on termination when one
  of the selector lines did not receive a message during the run (very
  unlikely)
- fixed an one-too-low memory allocation in the TCP sender. Could result
  in rsyslogd dumping core.
- fixed a bug in the TCP sender that caused the retry logic to fail
  after an error or receiver overrun
- fixed a bug in init() that could lead to dumping core
- fixed a bug that could lead to dumping core when no HOSTNAME or no TAG
  was present in the syslog message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.2 (RGer), 2005-10-05
- fixed an issue with MySQL error reporting. When an error occured,
  the MySQL driver went into an endless loop (at least in most cases).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1 (RGer), 2005-09-23
- fixed a security issue with SQL-escaping in conjunction with
  no
